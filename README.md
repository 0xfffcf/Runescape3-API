> # Introduction.

* This API is based on Kraken API. I made it because Kraken was really low level.
* I am willing to help the community of scripter a lot and I am far from being a professional when it comes to it.

<br/>

> # Features.

* Bank Class
* Dialogue Class
* Inventory Class
* Object Class
* Tree Model

<br/>

> # Setup.

```
Build the source code to .jar and use it as a java library
```

<br/>

> # Future.

* More Models.

<br/>
